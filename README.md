Installation

### To make a fork

The files contained within the repository must be placed inside a minecraft forge-universal src installation.
Due to potential legal issues of re-distributing Mojang .java files, all base class edits are distributed as .java.patch files. They serve only as documentation.
You can set a dev environment by Gradle, with IntelliJIdea:
`` gradlew setupDecompWorkspace idea genIntellijRuns``
or Eclipse:
`` gradlew setupDecompWorkspace eclipse``
then import the build.gradle file.

### To make an addon

The files in /battlegear api folder can be used as external libraries.
M.U.D and Battlegear are independent.
To load them while making the addon, simply put them in the /mods folder in your mod run installation.

Compiling the Mod
-----------------
The mod can be compiled using the following gradle command
``gradlew build``

This will generate a jar file in the battlegear dist folder, along with its checksum.

Some Notes for Texture Pack Makers
----------------------------------

Some rendering capabilities of the mod are still in development, especially concerning the heraldry. The following are a few notes.
* The patterns should only have white. The white section will determine the secondary colour. The primary colour will be the alpha section. Semi transparent sections should also work for better blending.
* The icons should be greyscale and alpha values. They also require at least 1 pixel border around the whole image that should be kept black. This is the reason all of them are 18x18 pixals (16x16 plus a 1px border all around)
